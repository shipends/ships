# Prologue --takes 2 min.

## In a Nutshell

Hardhat is used for `building` smart contracts -- _fast_ + _easy_. Think of it as **[Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)**,
but more powerful.

## A view of your Voyage

We got 7 _sections_ -- each covering a specific part of Hardhat. **You** will go from `setting up` local environment
to verifying `production ready` smart contracts on Etherscan -- _everything @_ **_Lightspeed_**.
