Push Protocol helps in sending notifications to any wallet address.

> Think of it as a _decentralized_ version of **YouTube**

On YouTube

-   You create your _Super Cool_ channel
-   Start uploading _dope_ videos
-   Interested people will `subscribe` your channel
-   All subscribers will receive `notifications` whenever you _post_ a new video

Similarly, you can do on Push Protocol **but** instead of just _videos/reels_ -- you can send notifications
on any events you can imagine like on smart contract function execution, chats
