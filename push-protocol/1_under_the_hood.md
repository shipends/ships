## Channel Analogy

To send _notifications_ to someone on web3, you need `something` that's actually going to send it -- that `something` is called the **channel**.

-   `Youtube` => Push Protocol
-   `Channel` => Channel
-   `Subscriber` => Subscriber
-   `Subscribe` => Opt-In
-   `Unsubscribe` => Opt-Out

> **Note:** Unlike YouTube, you can create only one channel per address on Push Protocol.

## Multi-chain

You can create a channel on Goerli Testnet, but can still send notification on Polygon Mumbai Testnet -- pretty cool right!
